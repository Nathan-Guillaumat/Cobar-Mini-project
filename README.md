# Cobar-Mini-project

Intruction to run the Jupyter Notebook:
- The code "Project_Nathan_Guillaumat" can be run all the way from the beginning to the end.
- Be careful when setting the variable run_time. It takes usually 1min to compute 1s of simulation. 15-30s of simulation seems to be a good range to see interesting behaviors of the fly.
- If the created image is not appreciated, you can run another one by running again the cell, the new image will be saved on the computer.
- The parameter K has been set to 100, feel free to decrease it if less eggs per minutes wants to be laid.
